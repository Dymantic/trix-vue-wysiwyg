# Vue Trix Wysiwyg

A Vue component to make it easy to use the trix wysiwyg editor as a simple form component or as a auto-saving content editor. Still heavily under construction - further documentation will come later.

### Tests

After endless hassles getting Trix and jsdom to play nicely, I abandoned automated tests for the time being. Will revisit at a later stage.
